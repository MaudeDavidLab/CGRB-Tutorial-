You may run into the situation where you want to develop on your local machine using either python through jupyter notebooks or R through Rstudio.

### Install Python
The easiest way is to install Anaconda, which is a program that will install python along with a bunch of the most useful python packages.
To install, go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/, and download and install the appropriate version for your computer.
