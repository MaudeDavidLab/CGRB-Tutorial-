# Setup Tutorial




# Getting Set Up

### Get a CGRB Account
1.	If you do not have an CGRB account, then you will need to create one by filling out the form at: http://shell.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/access/
2.	Have a graduate student email Chris Sullivan to make sure the process moves quickly

### Getting a Terminal:
#### Windows Users: Download a free Secure Shell (ssh). You can use either Moba
or Putty. I recommend Moba. 
###### Option 1: Moba
•	Download MobaXterm: http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home- edition.html (Use Installer Edition)

•	Once you have a CGRB account and installed MobaXterm, open MobaXterm. Go to Sessions -> New Session, and click on the SSH icon.

•	Enter shell.cgrb.oregonstate.edu as the remote host, and click on the Specify Username (this is your ONID) checkbox to enter your username in the appropriate field. Change port to 732

•	Click on the Bookmark settings tab to save your session with a specific name, e.g. CGRB

•	The CGRB session you just created will connect, and you will be asked to enter your
password at the prompt. **Note: You will not see anything as you type your password. This is a security feature in Linux!!!
•	After a successful logon, press enter at the prompt below: Terminal type? [xterm]
•	Then you get a prompt that looks something like this:

###### Option 2: Putty
•	Download Putty here: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe
•	Once you have the software, launch PuTTY and you will see the following screen:

•	In the "Host Name (or IP address)" field, type: "shell.cgrb.oregonstate.edu"
•	Change the port to 732
•	Select open
•	You will then be prompted to enter your username and password

### Get VPN
If you are connecting off-campus, you must first have a VPN. Follow the tutorial: https://cosine.oregonstate.edu/faqs/vpn
